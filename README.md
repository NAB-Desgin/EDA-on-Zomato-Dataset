## 📊 Key Analysis Performed

### 1️⃣ Data Cleaning
- Handled missing values
- Removed duplicates
- Converted data types
- Cleaned and formatted rating column

### 2️⃣ Rating Analysis
- Distribution of ratings
- Average rating analysis
- Rating vs Votes relationship

### 3️⃣ Votes Analysis
- Top restaurants based on votes
- High engagement restaurants

### 4️⃣ Location-Based Analysis
- Restaurant count per location
- Most popular restaurant areas

### 5️⃣ Cost Analysis
- Approximate cost for two distribution
- Cost vs Rating comparison

## 📈 Visualizations Used

- Bar Plots
- Count Plots
- Distribution Plots
- Correlation Heatmap
- Location-wise Analysis Graphs

---

## 🔍 Key Insights

- Higher rated restaurants tend to receive more votes.
- Some locations dominate in restaurant density.
- Cost does not always guarantee higher ratings.
- Online ordering impacts customer engagement.
